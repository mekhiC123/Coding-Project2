# Coding-Project2
Browsers and Download coding project
Designed and implemented a simulated web browser with fundamental navigation and file downloading features in C++.
Employed a Stack data structure to track visited web pages, enabling seamless navigation back to previous pages following the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.
Utilized a Queue data structure to efficiently manage file downloads, ensuring files are downloaded in a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) manner, enhancing user experience and file management efficiency within the program.
